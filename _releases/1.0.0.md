The 1.0.0 release features support for user groups, improved clipboard
integration leveraging the Asynchronous Clipboard API, as well as support for
TOTP (Google Authenticator), RADIUS, and dead keys.

**This release contains changes which break compatibility with past releases.**
Please see the [deprecation / compatibility
notes](#deprecation--compatibility-notes) section for more information.


New features and improvements
-----------------------------

### Support for user groups

Guacamole now supports granting permissions based on group membership. While
this has been supported to a degree for some time via LDAP and the `seeAlso`
attribute, groups can now be defined and used within a database, with LDAP and
a database combined, or within other extensions using Guacamole's extension
API.

 * [GUACAMOLE-220](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-220) - Implement user groups

### Clipboard integration with the Asynchronous Clipboard API

For browsers which implement the [Asynchronous Clipboard
API](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/#async-clipboard-api), Guacamole will
now automatically synchronize the local and remote clipboards. Users will be
prompted to grant clipboard access upon opening Guacamole, and Guacamole will
synchronize the clipboard if access is granted.

This API [has been implemented in Google Chrome since version
66](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/clipboardapi), and other
browsers will likely follow suit. The legacy synchronous clipboard API will
continue to be used as a fallback for browsers that support clipboard access
but lack support for the newer API (Internet Explorer).

 * [GUACAMOLE-559](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-559) - Add support for the new Asynchronous Clipboard API

### Multi-factor authentication with Google Authenticator / TOTP

Guacamole now has support for TOTP as an additional authentication factor.
TOTP ([Time-based One-Time Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm))
is a [standardized algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) used for
multi-factor authentication. With this new support, Guacamole may be used with
any application or authentication device which supports the TOTP standard,
including the popular Google Authenticator.

 * [GUACAMOLE-96](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-96) - Two factor authentication with Google Authenticator

### Support for RADIUS authentication

RADIUS support has been added, allowing Guacamole to delegate authentication to
a RADIUS service like FreeRADIUS for validating credentials, enforcing multiple
authentication factors, etc.

Because the RADIUS library used by this support is licensed under the LGPL, a
convenience binary for this extension is not provided. If you wish to use the
RADIUS support, you will need to [build guacamole-client from
source](/doc/1.0.0/gug/installing-guacamole.html) and explicitly enable that
part of the build with `-P`:

    mvn package -Plgpl-extensions

Instructions for building this support are [provided in the
manual](/doc/1.0.0/gug/radius-auth.html).

 * [GUACAMOLE-197](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-197) - Implement Support for RADIUS Authentication

### Support for creating ad-hoc connections

An extension is now provided which allows users to create arbitrary, temporary
connections through entering a URL. This ability can be quite convenient, as
users need not create new connections through the administrative interface in
order to quickly access a particular machine.

Be sure you understand the [security implications of providing this level of
access](/doc/1.0.0/gug/adhoc-connections.html). A Guacamole connection
implicitly has network and filesystem access to the Guacamole server, thus
providing this ability is equivalent to granting your users those privileges.

 * [GUACAMOLE-38](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-38) - On-Demand connection

### Improved keyboard handling / Support for dead keys

Multiple improvements have been made to handling keyboards, including bug fixes
for various clients and support for dead keys.

 * [GUACAMOLE-161](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-161) - Handle CapsLock events properly on Mac OS
 * [GUACAMOLE-232](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-232) - Stuck keys iPad/Bluetooth keyboard (Return/Backspace/Space)
 * [GUACAMOLE-352](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-352) - Add support for dead keys
 * [GUACAMOLE-447](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-447) - Certain keys fail for external keyboards on iOS Safari

### Automatic connection behavior

Guacamole has a feature that, if a user has access to only a single connection,
they will be automatically connected to it and skip the home screen.  This feature
has been tweaked slightly so that users with elevated access to the Guacamole
Client (Administrative, ability to create connections) will be taken to the
home screen and not automatically taken to the connection.

 * [GUACAMOLE-508](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-508) - Automatically connect only if user lacks access to settings

### Support for renaming RDP drive and printer

A handful of changes allow for changing how the RDP protocol handles naming
of the RDP client and redirected filesystem and printers passed through
via Guacmaole.

 * [GUACAMOLE-445](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-445) - Allow RDP printer name to be configured
 * [GUACAMOLE-446](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-446) - Allow RDP drive name to be configured
 * [GUACAMOLE-523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-523) - Use client_name for redirected devices

### Configurable terminal color schemes

The Guacamole terminal now allows for finer control of terminal color
schemes by allowing for the individual colors of a scheme to be customized.

 * [GUACAMOLE-470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-470) - Make individual terminal colors configurable through "color-scheme" parameter

### Optional recording of input events

Guacamole has supported recording sessions for quite some time, but input
events were not recorded (mouse movement, mouse clicks, keyboard input, etc.).
Options are now present for capturing the input events during session
recording.  These events are disabled by default, for security and privacy
reasons, but can be enabled if desired.

 * [GUACAMOLE-313](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-313) - Allow input events within session recording

### SSH host key verification

SSH host key verification is now implemented and can be enabled and configured
within Guacamole.  In the past, Guacamole has not done any host key checking,
and version 1.0.0 introduces that capability.  It is important to note that
this functionality is still disabled by default - if known host keys are not
provided, Guacamole will continue to behave as it has in the past and will not
perform host key checking.  If host keys are provided, however, either in a
known_hosts file within the GUACAMOLE_HOME directory on the server running
guacd, or by passing in a parameter to the connection with the key of the
specific server.

 * [GUACAMOLE-527](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-527) - Add parameter for specifying known SSH/SFTP server host key

### Automatic detection of network issues

 * [GUACAMOLE-567](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-567) - Network connection problem acknowledgement/feedback

### Support for configuring Guacamole with environment variables

Support has been added for specifying any of the properties supported in the
GUACAMOLE_HOME/guacamole.properties file by setting environment variables that
resemble the names of the parameters.  The variables are all caps and replace
dashes with underscores.

 * [GUACAMOLE-464](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-464) - Extension configuration properties from the OS environment

### Improvements to `guacamole/guacd` and `guacamole/guacamole` Docker images

Many improvments have been made to the Docker support files for building
and running Guacamole within Docker containers.  Most notable among these is
that the default image for Guacamole Server has been changed from CentOS7
to the latest Debian stable.  This allows for more recent, but still stable,
versions of libraries to be used to support the various protocols and features
of guacd.

 * [GUACAMOLE-42](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-42) - Support setting guacd log level on Docker container
 * [GUACAMOLE-407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-407) - Update guacd Docker image to build against more recent dependencies
 * [GUACAMOLE-450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-450) - Change Tomcat Version in Dockerfile to major release
 * [GUACAMOLE-553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-553) - Docker image need a new MySQL JDBC driver for MySQL 8.0

### General usability improvements

A few changes address the usability of both the client and the server by
adding functionality that addresses issues reported by users.  Guacamoel now
supports Ctrl-Alt-End as a hotkey for sending Ctrl-Alt-Delete to remote systems,
which is a widely-used hotkey among remote desktop clients.  The zoom level
of the client can be specified more granularly, connections are easier
to click on in the web interface, and guacd now provides a flag for
outputting the build version.

 * [GUACAMOLE-113](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-113) - Add Ctrl+Alt+Del hotkey
 * [GUACAMOLE-152](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-152) - Difficult to reach specific zoom levels
 * [GUACAMOLE-304](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-304) - Clicking area to open connection
 * [GUACAMOLE-351](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-351) - Version parameter for guacd

### General improvements to terminal behavior

A few updates address improving compatibility of the terminal across
different connections, particularly when dealing with non-Linux operating
systems.  Parameters have been added for configuring the terminal type
reported to the remote system, and for adjusting what code the backspace
key sends.  The terminal has also been adjusted to hide escape sequences
and control codes that were previously outputted to the screen.

 * [GUACAMOLE-269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-269) - Add support for alternative backspace/delete control codes
 * [GUACAMOLE-564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-564) - Hide APC escape sequence for terminal
 * [GUACAMOLE-565](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-565) - Add terminal type parameter

### Support for systemd

A template systemd init script has been provided and can be built with
Guacamole Server to allow for xyxtem startup on distributions that
have moved from init scripts to systemd.

 * [GUACAMOLE-30](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-30) - Add Systemd init script for guacd-server

### Control of RDP bitmap and glyph caching

Parameters have been added to RDP connections that allow for controlling
how the RDP protocol behaves for caching bitmaps, glyphs, and off-screen
data.  The default behavior remains un-changed, with caching of all of these
items enabled, but, for certain scenarios where it may be desirable to
change this behavior the parameters are present.

 * [GUACAMOLE-448](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-448) - Add parameters for controlling RDP bitmap/glyph/off-screen caching

Internationalization
--------------------

### Additional RDP keymaps

Several keymaps have been added or updated for better support for keyboard
input on both the Guacamole Client side and on remote systems.

 * [GUACAMOLE-233](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-233) - Add Spanish keymap for RDP
 * [GUACAMOLE-273](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-273) - Add Portuguese Brazilian keymap for RDP
 * [GUACAMOLE-434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-434) - Add UK English keymap for RDP
 * [GUACAMOLE-481](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-481) - Add Turkish Q keymap for RDP
 * [GUACAMOLE-517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-517) - Print screen key definition missing from RDP base keymap

### Spanish translation of web interface

The entire web interface has been translated into Spanish, including section
and field headers on the web interface, on-screen keyboard, and remote system
support.

 * [GUACAMOLE-463](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-463) - Spanish translation for Guacamole client
 * [GUACAMOLE-530](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-530) - Add Spanish on screen keyboard

Bug fixes
---------

### Hostname / desktop name regression

An issue was corrected where the hostname or desktop name replaced the
connection name on the tab or window title in the browser.  The behavior
has been reverted to the desired behavior, where the connection name is
displayed.

 * [GUACAMOLE-502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-502) - Hostname / desktop name replaces connection name

### General connection stability

Several fixes address issues with the stability of connections opened
with Guacamole, either between Guacamole Client and Server, or between
Server and remote systems.

 * [GUACAMOLE-324](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-324) - Incorrect buffer used in socket write
 * [GUACAMOLE-384](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-384) - Terminal writes during disconnect may segfault
 * [GUACAMOLE-424](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-424) - VNC client segfaults if provided password is incorrect
 * [GUACAMOLE-489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-489) - Secondary socket of "tee" socket is not threadsafe
 * [GUACAMOLE-533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-533) - Automatically kill wayward guacd processes

### Issues with database authentication behavior and SQL queries

 * [GUACAMOLE-505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-505) - Individual user query fails after two or more login history entries exist
 * [GUACAMOLE-525](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-525) - Creating user results in "Incorrect syntax near 'LIMIT'"
 * [GUACAMOLE-529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-529) - Despite the fact user account is disabled, user account can access to a welcome blank screen
 * [GUACAMOLE-540](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-540) - Discrepancy with remote_host between tables

### Incorrect status reported for sessions closed by RDP server

 * [GUACAMOLE-484](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-484) - UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE incorrectly reported for sessions closed by RDP server

### CAS authorization URI derived incorrectly

To ensure comptability across CAS various implementations of the CAS
protocol, the "/login" portion of the URI has been added to the code
that performs the CAS login.

 * [GUACAMOLE-457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-457) - CAS authentication provider omits login URI

### Build issues for guacamole-server

A couple of fixes were introduced for build issues for Guacamole
server components for various libraries and compilers.

 * [GUACAMOLE-485](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-485) - pango is required with pango support disabled
 * [GUACAMOLE-500](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-500) - Terminal build fails against GCC 7

### Fixes for guacenc behavior and protocol implementation

A few bugs were squashed in the guacenc program that caused error
messages and erratic behavior under certain conditions.

 * [GUACAMOLE-307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-307) - guacenc reports "Layer index out of bounds: -1"
 * [GUACAMOLE-482](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-482) - Return value of guacenc_video_flush_frame() not handled
 * [GUACAMOLE-490](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-490) - guacenc does not take channel mask into account for image streams

### Issues specific to Internet Explorer

Changes were introduced that fix IE-specific issues that either
caused problems or had the potential to impact compatibility with
various versions of IE.

 * [GUACAMOLE-316](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-316) - IE Compatibility mode doesn't work
 * [GUACAMOLE-347](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-347) - IE may lack window.location.origin
 * [GUACAMOLE-348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-348) - Stream download iframe may not exist in DOM at time of removal

### Use of deprecated `navigator.getUserMedia()`

The navigator.getuserMedia() method has been deprecated, so the
Guacamole Client code has been adjusted to remove reliance upon
that method.

 * [GUACAMOLE-237](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-237) - navigator.getUserMedia() deprecated

### Incorrect documentation for RDP `load-balance-info` parameter

Documentation was corrected for the load-balance-info parameter.

 * [GUACAMOLE-427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-427) - RDP "load-balance-info" parameter incorrectly documented

### Erroneous inclusion of "guaclog" binary in source tree

The guaclog binary was accidentally included in one of the source
code releases and in the git repository.  It has been removed.

 * [GUACAMOLE-492](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-492) - guaclog binary erroneously included in source tree

Platform / API changes
----------------------

### **Java 8 or later is now required**

As noted in the compatibility section below, the Guacamole Client
code has been updated such that Java 1.8 is required for both
build and runtime.

 * [GUACAMOLE-497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-497) - Ensure guacamole-client source is compatible with Java 9
 * [GUACAMOLE-635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-635) - Build against and require Java 1.8

### Guacamole no longer uses cookies

The Guacamole Client has been updated such that cookies are no longer
used to store the authentication information, and it is, instead, stored
in the localStorage of the local browser.

 * [GUACAMOLE-549](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-549) - Store auth token within localStorage

### Removal of NoAuth and other deprecated components

Several components that were previously marked as deprecated have been
removed entirely from the code base.  This includes the NoAuth extension
and several old properties and API endpoints.

 * [GUACAMOLE-493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-493) - Remove the NoAuth extension entirely
 * [GUACAMOLE-494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-494) - Remove support for old, deprecated properties
 * [GUACAMOLE-495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-495) - Remove support for old, deprecated portions of API

### Improvements to extension API

The extension API has been updated with several changes designed to
streamline functionality and make development and maintenance of
extensions easier and more consistent.  The error codes sent by
the REST API are now derived from the GuacamoleStatus data structure
rather than being separately calculated.  Dependency precendence has
been updated so that the dependencies bundled with the WebApp are
preferred over the ones bundled with the extensions.  Base implementations
of UserContext and AuthenticationProvider modules have been provided
and current extensions updated to make use of those, reducing the overall
amount of code to maintain and making implementation of future modules
more straight-forward.  Finally, the RESTExceptionMapper class was replaced
by the RESTExceptionWrapper class, which also makes it possible for
extensions to generate their own exceptions that can be handled by the
web applicatlon.

 * [GUACAMOLE-499](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-499) - REST API Error Codes should come from GuacamoleStatus
 * [GUACAMOLE-541](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-541) - Webapp dependencies take precedence over bundled extension dependencies
 * [GUACAMOLE-542](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-542) - Provide base implementations of UserContext and AuthenticationProvider
 * [GUACAMOLE-566](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-566) - Add RESTExceptionWrapper support for extensions

### Web application updated to AngularJS 1.6.9

The AngularJS code was updated from the 1.3.x code to the latest
available 1.x code, which was 1.6.9 at the time of the update.  Several
portion of the code were reworked for compatibility with this, including
significant portions of the HTTP request code and how exceptions are
handled within those requests.

 * [GUACAMOLE-526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-526) - Update Guacamole-Client Webapp to Angular 1.6.9

### Improvements to Java / JavaScript tunnel API

Changes were introduced to improve how the tunnel is handled between the
Java and JavaScript portions of the code, including allowing custom
headers to be configured for the tunnels and insuring that the tunnels
are not closed more than once.

 * [GUACAMOLE-431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-431) - Tunnel implementations handles close only once
 * [GUACAMOLE-437](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GUACAMOLE-437) - Allow to configure custom headers for Guacamole tunnels

Deprecation / Compatibility notes
=================================

As of 1.0.0, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:


**Java 8 or later is now required**
-----------------------------------

Most of the Java components of the Guacamole Client have been updated to
require Java 1.8 for both compile and runtime.  The decision was made
based on the fact that many support libraries are moving toward
requiring later versions of Java, that Java 1.8 has been out and stable
for many years, and that Java 1.6 and 1.7 have not been updated in
several years.  The only exception to this is the base API, the
guacamole-common code, which continues to maintain compatibility with
Java 1.6.

Database schema changes
-----------------------

Significant changes have been made to the schemas for all of the JDBC
authentication modules (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server).  Among those
changes are the addition of support for user groups and the changes
required to support those within the database modules (including the
"entity" as an overall type for both users and groups).

Users of any of the database authentication modules will need to run the
`upgrade-pre-1.0.0.sql` script specific to their chosen database as part
of the move from earlier versions of Guacamole to 1.0.0.  More thorough
instructions for this process can be found in the [`JDBC Authentcation`]
(http://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/jdbc-auth.html) documentation.

Hostname logging within database
--------------------------------

The hostname/address of users logged by the database authentication backend is
now determined entirely by the servlet container. The database authentication
will not manually parse the `X-Forwarded-For` header, and will instead rely on
the servlet container to perform any such parsing.

If proxying Guacamole, the configuration of your servlet container should be
updated to handle the headers set by your proxy. For Apache Tomcat, this is
accomplished with a [`RemoteIpValve`](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/RemoteIpValve.html)
in your `server.xml`.

Logging of hostnames/addresses by Guacamole during the authentication process
(as would be parsed by tools like fail2ban) is unchanged, however you will need
to update the pattern if `RemoteIpValve` or similar are used, as the address of
interest will likely be the rightmost address. If the user is not behind any
additional, untrusted proxies, the address of interest will be the *only*
address.

Removal of deprecated NoAuth extension
--------------------------------------

The NoAuth extension has been deprecated for a couple of major releases of
Guacamole, and has been entirely removed from the code base in this release,
both source and binary releases.  If you are currently using this extension
you will need to move to a different authentication extension during the
upgrade process, as the NoAuth extension will no longer work.

Removal of deprecated properties
--------------------------------

The following properties have been deprecated for quite some time, and
are completely removed in the 1.0.0 release.  Prior to the 1.0.0 release
a warning would be logged regarding the deprecation of these properties;
as of this release they will be completely ignored if present in the
guacamole.properties file.

* `basic-user-mapping`
* `mysql-disallow-simultaneous-connections`
* `mysql-disallow-duplicate-connections`
* `postgresql-disallow-simultaneous-connections`
* `postgresql-disallow-duplicate-connections`

Extension API changes
---------------------

### Support for user groups

As noted above, one of the major changes in this version of the Guacamole
Client is the addition of support for user groups across all authentication
modules.  This includes changes in the core Extension API (guacamole-ext)
that supports the user groups and allows for those groups to be processed
across various stacked modules and implemented in newer modules.  The
AbstractUserGroup, DelegatingUserGroup, SimpleUserGroup, and UserGroup
classes have been added to the Extension API to be implemented within
various extension modules.

### The new decoration API

The 1.0.0 version of the Guacamole Client introduces several classes
that allow extension modules to decorate other modules, providing the
ability to modules to build on top of other modules and store data in
other modules.  This was key in allowing the TOTP module to function by
allowing it to store arbitrary data in the databases provided by the
JDBC module, and paves the way for future expansion on how modules
leverage data and functionality from other modules.

### Removal of deprecated `GuacamoleHome` and `GuacamoleProperties` classes

TODO

### Deprecation of `SimpleUserDirectory`, `SimpleConnectionDirectory`, and `SimpleConnectionGroupDirectory` classes

The SimpleUserDirectory, SimpleConnectionDirectory, and
SimpleConnectionGroupDirectory classes have been deprecated in favor
of the SimpleDirectory<T> class.  These classes can still be used,
but will result in deprecation warnings, and will be removed in
a future release.

### Deprecation of `SimpleUser` convenience constructors

TODO

libguac API changes
-------------------

### `guac_protocol_send_mouse()` now requires additional parameters

TODO

### `GUAC_INSTRUCTION_MAX_ELEMENTS` macro definition changed

TODO (Affects size of `guac_parser` as well as any code referencing that macro)

Java API (guacamole-common) changes
-----------------------------------

### Removal of deprecated `GuacamoleSession` class

TODO

### Change in definition of `GuacamoleHTTPTunnelServler.sendError()`

TODO

JavaScript API changes
----------------------

### Removal of deprecated `GuacamoleClient.setClipboard()` function

TODO

### Addition of `Guacamole.Tunnel.State.UNSTABLE` state

In order to support changes to detecting and handling network
problems within the Guacamole connections, another tunnel state,
UNSTABLE, has been added.  Custom code that leverages the
Guacamole.Tunnel.State type may need to be refactored to take
this additional state into account if it does not currently
ignore unknown states, or the code needs to handle unstable
connections.

### Internal WebSocket tunnel implementation changes

TODO (New use of internal tunnel opcode for connection stability "ping" will affect third-party reimplementations of Guacamole's WebSocket tunnel)
